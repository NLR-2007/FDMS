Flood Disaster Management System
Project Overview
The Flood Disaster Management System is a real-time, responsive web dashboard designed to monitor and manage flood conditions. It provides a centralized interface for viewing live water levels, sensor data, and a log of past alerts. The system is built with a modern front-end design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices for quick and efficient disaster response.

Features
Homepage / Dashboard: Displays the current water level with a clear, color-coded status indicator (Safe, Warning, Critical).

Live Updates: A dedicated section that automatically refreshes to show the latest sensor readings and their corresponding timestamps.

Alert Log: A historical table detailing past alerts, including the type of alert and its delivery status.

Map Integration: Visually represents the sensor's location on an interactive map.

Responsive Design: The dashboard layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using a modern card and grid layout with soft shadows and rounded corners.

About Section: Provides a detailed explanation of the system's components, such as the ESP32 microcontroller, sensors, and communication modules.

Contact Section: Lists emergency contact details for administrators.

Backend Integration (Simulated): The website is structured to fetch data from an API endpoint. For demo purposes, it can be run using a simulated JSON data source.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the website structure and content.

CSS: For styling and visual presentation.

JavaScript: For dynamic content updates, data handling, and interactive elements.

Bootstrap / Tailwind: For a responsive, mobile-first design framework.

Leaflet.js: For the interactive map integration.

Font Awesome: For icons and visual enhancements.

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Future Enhancements
Integration with a live backend to fetch real-time data from physical sensors.

User authentication and role-based access control.

Advanced analytics and reporting features.
